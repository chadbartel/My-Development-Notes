## Summary

> Amazon EKS is a managed service that makes it easy for you to use Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane.

## How It Works

> Amazon EKS exposes a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) API endpoint. Your existing Kubernetes tooling can connect directly to EKS managed control plane. Worker nodes run as EC2 instances in your account.
